2.0
---

This release adds build fixes, fixes the detection of a number of
devices that should be supported, stops trying to use devices
that shouldn't, and adds support for the "mount-matrix" property,
which can be used to fix the orientation of accelerometers on
devices where the default does not work.

- Add support for ACCEL_MOUNT_MATRIX udev property
- Fix startup failure on certain devices
- Work-around possible kernel bug on certain devices
- Better supported/unsupported sensors detection
- Better debug output

This release adds build fixes, fixes accelerometer unit scaling and
really fixes regression with the IIO accelerometer in kernel 4.8 that
was supposed to be fixed in version 1.2.

1.2
---

This release mainly adds better debug output, and updated testing
instructions in the README.

- Fix regression with IIO accelerometer in kernel 4.8
- Fix possible crash in compass handling

1.1

This release adds support for Compasses (only accessible to GeoClue).

- Fix service not starting in a number of cases
- Fix excessive CPU usage monitoring light sensors on Macs
- Support light sensors on some Samsung laptops
- Fix incorrect sensor readings on some devices due to unit scaling

1.0

This is the first stable release of iio-sensor-proxy. It now uses a D-Bus API,
and supports accelerometers and ambient light sensors.

0.1
---

This is the first version of iio-sensor-proxy. It supports accelerometers,
proxying IIO sensors, and mimicking input device accelerometers.
